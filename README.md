## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Tools Used

* **Data Cleaning (Power Query):** Loaded the raw `.csv` file into Power Query to transform the data.
    * Checked and corrected data types (e.g., changed `Postal Code` from a number to text).
    * Removed unnecessary columns to optimize the model.
* **Data Analysis (Pivot Tables):** Created multiple pivot tables to answer key questions:
    * What are the total sales by region?
    * What are the total sales by product category?
* **Data Visualization (Dashboarding):**
    * Created **Pivot Charts** (Pie and Bar charts) from the pivot tables.
    * Arranged all charts onto a single "Dashboard" sheet.
    * Removed gridlines and formatted charts for a clean, professional look.
* **Interactivity (Slicers):**
    * Added a **Slicer** for "Ship Mode".
    * Used **"Report Connections"** to link the slicer to *both* pivot tables, allowing the entire dashboard to be filtered from one control.
